jQuery is a fast, small and feature-rich JS library.

- purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JS on your web site. Write-less & Do-more.

- It is most widely used JS library.
- It is open source and free to use.
- It is cross-browser compitible

- jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JS code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.

- It also simplifies a lot of comlicated things from JS, like AJAX calls DOM manipulation.

jQuery contains features like:

    - HTML/DOM manipulation
    - CSS manipulation
    - HTML event methods
    - Effects and animations
    - AJAX
    - Utilities

In JS we used functions like getElementById, Name, TagName etc. to manipulate HTML DOM elements.
In jQuery we use selectors to do so.
It has basic CSS selectors, and in addition it has also some own custom selectors.

    Selectors: https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_selectors.asp

    Syntax:
            document.getElementById('lol');
            $('#lol')

            document.getElementByTagName('h1')
            $('h1')

            after selector, we also have to specify what action we want to do on that selector.

            $('#target').action();

    Generally we write jquery code inside 
    
    $(document).ready()

    which means all the code should run only after whole HTML document is loaded and ready.

    i.e)
    $(document).ready( function(){
        $('#lol').click( function (){
            $(this).hide();
        });
    });

    jquery Events: https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_events.asp

    i.e)
    $('#lol').dblclick( ()=>{
        $(this).hide();
    });

    // hover event takes 2 functions as arguments

    $('p').mouseenter(show);
    $('p').mouseleave(hide);
    or
    $('p').hover(show, hide);

    Both do similar work.

*) some DOM manipulation methods are..

    // examples are in 'DOM_Manipulation' files
    text()
    html()
    attr() - returns the value of specified attribute of element
    append() - adds content at the end of the element
    prepend() - adds content at the begining of the element
    after() - adds content after(outside) specified element
    before() - adds content before(outside) specified element
    css() - sets or returns style attribute
    addCalss() - add a class to html element
    removeClass() - remove a class from html element
    toggleClass() - add/remove a class to/from html element
