It defines the structure of the web page, using tags such as <div>, <p> etc.

CSS is used to appy designs/visuals such as colors, borders etc.

How does the JS interact with the HTML ?
Here the DOM comes in the picture.

Document Object Model in JS is used to  interact with the HTML.

DOM is JavaScript's view of HTML document

When HTML document is loaded in the browser, corresponding to that document, another representation of that document is created which is know as DOM.

Each HTML tags are represented as objects in DOM.
Objects means it has properties as well as methods.
